# Pneumonia-Detection
This is the Pneumonia detection web app wherein user need to uplaod chest x-ray image to diagnose if the patient has Pneumonia or not.
* You may refer my kaggle notebook where I trained three different models [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
### Steps followed to creating this project:
  * Collected a dataset consisting x-ray images from kaggle. [here is the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
  * Made a split of data as training, validation and test dataset.
  * Trained three different models:
      1. Simple CNN model
      2. VGG-16 model
      3. ResNet50 model
  * Saved the model which gave best accuracy and recall.
  * Created a django app for making the classification.
